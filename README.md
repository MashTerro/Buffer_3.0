## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Implementing graph data structure for ONLINE CAB/AUTO BOOKING 
## FEATURES:
1. This is a console-based programme which simulates Online Cab/Auto Booking.
2. It enables the user to register with their username and phone number. 
3. The user can choose his/her source and destination as per given in the menu.
4. Users can book his cab/auto as per his/her will and cab driver will be assigned with all the details.
5. The cab/auto booking details are displayed later on and user can  also cancel it.
## DATA STRUCTURES USED:
 ### 1. GRAPH DATA STRUCTURE:
      It is used to store locations and distance between the locations and process all neighbours of present node.
      Using DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM minimum distance is calculated and shortest path can be found.
      The minimum distance auto/cab is booked for user efficiency. 
      At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex that is in the other set and has a minimum distance from the source. 
#### Instead of array,arraylist is used as size of the arraylists is dynamic.
### 2. PRIORITY QUEUE
     Here the only drawback with Dijkstra algorithms is that while finding the shortest path as listed as follows as we need to find the least cost path by going through the whole cost array.So we apply the concept of priority queues with this algorithm to erupt out some of the disadvantages and making complexity much better.
     To store the nodes in dijkstras algorithm. 
### 3. HashSet
     It is used to access the vertices randomly. 

## LEARNINGS AND OUTCOMES:
1. Importance and application of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Flowcharts
2. Application and implementation of various non-linear and linear data structures
3. Importance of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding minimum distance.
4. Learned efficient uses od=f various data structures and GUI in java.
5. Learned a powerful tool - GitHub
## WHAT'S NEXT:
1.Adding multiple locations and destinations and giving wide range of scopes.
