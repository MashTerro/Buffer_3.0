### overview

This online pizza delivery portal acts like a digital menu provided to customers when they enter the pizzeria.

It overcomes the demerits of the manual hotel system and the old fashioned queuing system.
The online food ordering system provides the menu online and the customers can easily place the order by just clicking the mouse or by touching the screen.

Also with the food ordering system online, people can easily place orders and admin can maintain customerâ€™s database and advance the food delivery system.

This food ordering system allows the user to select the desired food items from a list of available menu items provided by the local hotel or restaurant. The user can place orders for the food items of their like from the list.
It also avoids the need of pizzeria owners to manually note down the order and maintain it physically making it easier for the owners as well as the users. 

### data structures used

1. Binary search tree

    In this project, BST is used to sort the nonveg and veg pizzas which will help in searching the required pizza.
    In a normal binary tree, if we need to search for an element, we need to traverse the entire tree(in the worst case). But in BST, we can optimize this by using its properties to our advantage.

2. Queue

    Orders confirmed are then put into a queue. 
    A queue is a linear data structure or a collection in Java that stores elements in a FIFO (First In, First Out) order. The queue collection has two ends i.e. front & rear. The orders are added at the rear and removed from the front.

3. Array

    Array is used to store tha pizza list of every customer

4. ArrayList

    ArrayList is used to store the information of customer( i.e. name,phone number) along with the pizza list of the customer.Here instead of array we have used arraylist,beacuse arralist is flexible and resizable.
    ArrayList class uses a dymanic array for storing the elements.
